      <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
      <p class="para">
        BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on
        a person's weight and height. It is commonly used to assess whether a
        person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. BMI is
        calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by their height
        (in meters squared).
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        BMI is a useful tool to assess whether a person is at a healthy weight
        or not, but it is not always a perfect indicator of health. For example,
        someone with a high amount of muscle mass may have a high BMI even
        though they are not overweight or obese. Additionally, BMI does not take
        into account other factors such as age, sex, or body composition, so it
        should be used in conjunction with other measures to assess overall
        health.
      </p>
      <h3>Ranges</h3>
      <p class="para">
        BMI ranges are typically categorized into different levels of body
        weight and are used to indicate whether a person is underweight, normal
        weight, overweight, or obese. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
        established the following BMI ranges for adults:
      </p>
      <ul class="para">
        <li>Underweight: BMI below 18.5</li>
        <li>Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9</li>
        <li>Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9</li>
        <li>Obese: BMI 30 or higher</li>
      </ul>
